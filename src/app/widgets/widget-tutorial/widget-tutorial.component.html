    <h3>Login to Signal K</h3>
    <p>
      The first step is to configure Signal K server authentication
      (<i>a pre-existing Signal K server username and password is required</i>).
      Use the table above to find the gesture, mouse or keyboard shortcut to open the Actions menu, then select the top
      right <strong>Settings button</strong>, then the top left <strong>Options button</strong>. Toggle <strong>Login
      to server</strong> and enter your Signal K credentials.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Why login?</strong> Logging in allows KIP to do two things: 1) to send commands to Signal K and 2) to save its configuration on the server so it can be shared between multiple devices. It is the recommended method to use KIP.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you don’t have a Signal K account, ask your Signal K administrator, access the Signal K Admin Settings / Users page and create a user or check your server’s documentation for setup instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        After entering your credentials, select <strong>Login</strong> or <strong>Connect</strong>. If successful, your connection status will update and live data will appear in KIP.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you see an error, double-check your username and password, and make sure your device is on the same network as your Signal K server.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Option 1: Load Demonstration Dashboards</h3>
    <p>
      Try the sample dashboards using data from your server:
      <br/>
      <button mat-raised-button style="margin-left: 15px;" (click)="loadDemoConfig()">Load Demo</button>
    </p>
    <h3>Option 2: Create Your Own Layout</h3>
    <p>
      The text you are reading is actually a widget that fills the dashboard. The screen
      is split in halves at the middle. This mode is called Chartplotter mode. It can later be turned
      off in Settings / Options / Display. Dashboards are "Locked" by default to prevent
      accidental modifications.
      To edit a dashboard, swipe left and hit the bottom unlock menu button.
      Note that you can add and manage dashboards using the Settings button from
      the Actions menu.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Try editing the Dashboard now to receive further instructions!</strong></p>
  } @else {
    <h2>Changing Layouts</h2>
    Follow these simple steps to learn how to change your dashboard layout:
    <ol>
      <li>Resize this Tutorial widget using the now visible dashed borders or corners arrows. Resize it so
      it does not take up all the screen. You need free space in your dashboard to add more widgets.
      You can delete this Tutorial widget later when you are done with the instructions.</li>
      <li>Touch & Hold or Click & Hold in an empty area to open the Add Widget selection panel.</li>
      <li>Choose a widget from the selection panel to add it to the dashboard.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Possible widget operations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Touch and drag</strong> to move widgets</li>
      <li><strong>Drag corners and sides</strong> to resize widgets</li>
      <li><strong>Double Tap</strong> on a widget to configure it</li>
      <li><strong>Press and Hold</strong> on a widget to delete or duplicate widgets</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Exiting dashboard edit mode</h2>
    <p>Use the Save or Cancel buttons in the lower right corner to either persist
      your changes or revert changes.</p>
    <h2>Adding more dashboards</h2>
    <p>Swipe left and hit the Dashboards button. From this page you can add, rename, order, delete,
      and duplicate entire dashboards.</p>
