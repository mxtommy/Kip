      <h5>Two options are available:</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Load Live Demo
          <p>To dive right in and see what KIP can do!
            Load the demo configuration with simulated data from demo.signalk.org. Note that an
            internet connection is required.</p>
          <button mat-raised-button (click)="loadDemoConfig()">Load Demo</button>
          <br/><br/>
        </li>
        <li>Connect to a Signal K server, then start configuring instruments
          <p>
            Configure KIP's Signal K server URL connection and connect to receive data. Use the
            "Set Sign In credentials" button to authenticate to the server with a pre existing
            Signal K user/password. This setting also tells KIP to save the widget configuration
            on the Signal K server under your user profile, so your widget configuration is shared
            by all devices that you log in from. See
            <a routerLink="/help">Configuration Management Help</a> for more instructions.

      </ol>
      <h4>Then start editing dashboards</h4>
        <p>
          Dashboards are "Locked" by default. This is to prevent accidental touch
          screens interaction from changing anything.
          A page layout is a screen where you can add, configure and remove widgets such as
          gauges and components. Multiple dashboards can be added to facilitate organization.
          To edit dashboards or widget layouts, you first need to access the Actions menu.
          To access the actions menu swipe left. Go Ahead try it now!
        </p>
