    <h3>Kip Installation Notes</h3>
    <p>For complete functionality, certain Signal K plugin should be installed on the server
      you are connecting to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>&#64;signalk-alarm-silencer: To silence Notifications on the server. This enables Kip
        to instruct the Signal K server to silence said alarm for on all devices supporting
        Signal K Notifications, else Kip will be silenced.</li>
      <li>&#64;signalk/signalk-autopilot: required for the N2k Autopilot to function.
        <br/><b>Use the Kip N2k autopilot at your own risk. Use with caution and constant
          supervision.</b></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div *ngIf="!unlockStatus">
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <h4>Two options are available:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Load Live Demo
        <p>To dive right in and see what KIP can do!
          Load the demo configuration with simulated data from demo.signalk.org. Note that an
          internet connection is required.</p>
        <button mat-raised-button (click)="loadDemoConfig()">Load Demo</button>
        <br/><br/>
      </li>
      <li>Connect to a Signal K server, then start configuring instruments
        <p>
          Configure KIP's Signal K server URL connection and connect to receive data. Use the
          "Set Sign In credentials" button to authenticate to the server with a pre existing
          Signal K user/password and enable KIP configuration to be shared by any device. See
          <a routerLink="/help">Configuration Management Help</a> for more instructions.
        </p>
        <button mat-raised-button routerLink="/settings">Configure</button>
        <br/>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Then start editing Page Layouts</h4>
      <p>
        Page layouts are "Locked" by default. This is to prevent accidental touch
        screens interaction from changing anything.
        A page layout is a screen where you can add, configure and remove the various
        avalable widgets such as gauges and components.
        Multiple pages can be added to facilitate organization.
        You can unlock page layout using the hamburger icon in the lower right corner
        and selecting "Configuration -> Edit Layout". Go Ahead try it now!
      </p>
    </div>

  <div *ngIf="unlockStatus">
    <h1>Next Steps...</h1>
    <h2>Configuring Page Layout</h2>
    <p>
      Now that the page layout is unlocked, you can do a few actions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The icon in the lower right can be used to select the Widget you would like to display</li>
      <li>The icon in the lower left can be used to "split" the pages into various areas.
        You can use area to display different widgets on one page. Areas can be resized
        to better fit designs</li>
      <li>The "X" in the upper right can be used to delete an area (basically undoing a split)</li>
      <li>Once a widget is selected, there will be a gear in the lower middle. Clicking
        it will allow you to setup the widget parameters</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Getting Data from Signalk</h2>
    <p>The next steps is to configure your connection to a Signal K server using the hamburger icon in the lower right corner
      and selecting "Configuration -> Settings".</p>
