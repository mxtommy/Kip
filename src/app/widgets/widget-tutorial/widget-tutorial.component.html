      <h3>Log in to Signal K</h3>
      <p>
        The first step is to configure Signal K server authentication (<i>a pre-existing Signal K
        server user/password is required</i>). Swipe left to open the Actions menu,
        hit Settings, toggle Login to server and enter you pre-existing Signal K credentials.

      <h3>Option 1: Load Demonstration Dashboards</h3>
      <p>
        Try the sample dashboards using data from your server. :
        <br/>
        <button mat-raised-button style="margin-left: 15px;" (click)="loadDemoConfig()">Load Demo</button>
      </p>
      <h3>Option 2: Create Your Own Layout</h3>
      <p>
        The text you are reading is actually a full screen widget in a dashboard.
        Dashboards are "Locked" by default to prevent accidental modifications.
        To edit a dashboard, swipe left and hit the bottom unlock menu button.
        You can later add and manage dashboards using the Dashboards page from
        the Actions menu.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Try editing the Dashboard now to receive further instructions!</strong></p>
    } @else {
      <h3>Build Your Layout</h3>
      <p>
        First, resize this Tutorial widget using the now visible dashed borders so
        it does not take up all the screen. You can delete this Tutorial widget later when you are
        done with the instructions.
        Then, to add a widget: in an empty dashboard area,
        press and hold. This will open the widget selection panel. Here you can choose from a
        variety of widgets.
      </p>
      <p>To manage widgets, you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Touch and drag</strong> to move widgets</li>
        <li><strong>Drag corners and sides</strong> to resize widgets</li>
        <li><strong>Double Tap</strong> on a widget to configure it</li>
        <li><strong>Press and Hold</strong> on a widget to delete or duplicate widgets</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Exit Dashboard Edit Mode</h3>
      <p>Use the Save or Cancel buttons in the lower right corner to either persist
        your changes or revert changes.</p>
      <h3>Add More Dashboards</h3>
