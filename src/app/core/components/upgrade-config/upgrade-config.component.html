<p class="warning"><strong>Heads up:</strong> The new version introduces a completely
  redesigned fullscreen interface with no navigation bar. Please review the input modes table below to get an understanding
  of the new ways to operate KIP before upgrading. After the upgrade, give yourself time to get comfortable with the
  changes.</p>

<h2>Migration Limitations</h2>
<p>
  <span class="warning">Important:</span> The new widget layout engine is <strong>completely different</strong> from the previous version. When you upgrade, your configuration will be migrated, but <strong>the way dashboards and widgets are arranged will change significantly</strong>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>All KIP configuration settings will be migrated.</li>
  <li>Each v2 Page layout will become a v3 Dashboard.</li>
  <li>All widgets and their settings will appear in their new dashboards.</li>
  <li>
    <span class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Widget positions, order, and sizes <strong>WILL BE LOST</strong>. After upgrading, dashboards will contain small widgets that you must reposition and resize manually.</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To upgrade your configuration, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    As a safety measure, if you are using Signal K authentication, manually back up your configuration. Make a copy of the <code>9.0.0.json</code> files found on the Signal K server in the following folders:
    <ul>
      <li><code>~/.signalk/applicationData/users/(username)/kip/</code></li>
      <li><code>~/.signalk/applicationData/global/kip/</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Upgrade</strong> button below.</li>
  <li>Once the upgrade is complete, KIP will restart and display the migrated dashboards.</li>
  <li>Reposition and resize your widgets as needed.</li>
  <li>Once satisfied, delete the <code>9.0.0.json</code> configuration files located in the previously mentioned folders. They are not needed any more.</li>
</ol>
