## When to Use GitHub Issues

Please open a GitHub issue anytime you:
- Want to request a feature or enhancement
- Find a bug or regression
- Notice incorrect documentation
- Have a reproducible performance or stability problem

ðŸ”— **Create or review issues here: [KIP GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mxtommy/Kip/issues)**

Before creating a new issue:
1. Use the search box to see if it already exists (add keywords like the widget name, setting, or error text).
2. If you find an existing issue, add a comment or reaction instead of opening a duplicate.

### What to Include in a Bug Report
Provide clear, specific details so we can reproduce and fix the problem faster:
- What you expected vs. what happened
- Steps to reproduce (numbered list if possible)
- KIP version (see About / build info) and deployment method (e.g. Signal K app store, manual build)
- Signal K server version
- Browser + version (e.g. Firefox 128, Chrome 129, Safari 18)
- Relevant widget(s) or data paths (e.g. `navigation.speedOverGround`)
- Screenshots or a short GIF (if visual)
- Console errors (from browser dev tools) if any

### Feature Requests
Tell us:
- The problem you want to solve (not only the solution you imagine)
- Why it matters / how it improves use onboard
- Any related Signal K paths or data sources
- Rough idea of UI needs (new widget? setting? config option?)

If youâ€™re willing to help test or prototypeâ€”say so. That speeds things up.

## Response Expectations
- Discord: often same-day community responses; core maintainer availability may vary.
- GitHub issues: triage typically within a few days; complex features may be discussed before acceptance.
- Pull requests: reviews depend on scopeâ€”small fixes are faster.

If something critical slips through, feel free to politely bump the issue after about a week.

## Contributing Beyond Issues
- Share dashboards, layouts, or usage patterns. Use the Discord #showcase chanel with a few pictures (great inspiration for others!).
- Help answer other usersâ€™ questions on Discord.
- Test new widgets or configuration flows and give feedback.

## Thank You
Your feedback, curiosity, and ideas directly shape KIP. Whether itâ€™s a tiny typo fix or a major feature conceptâ€”every contribution moves the project forward.

Fair winds, and happy hacking.
