# Managing Dashboards
You can organize your dashboards from the Dashboards page. To edit a dashboard layout, first visualize the dashboard and unlock it.

## Dashboard Pages
On the Dashboards page, you can add, reorder, delete, rename, and duplicate dashboards. Each dashboard can have a custom name and icon for easy identification. The dashboard name is briefly visible when you cycle through dashboards. Available actions include:
- **Long press** a dashboard to delete or duplicate it.
- **Double tap** a dashboard to rename it and select an icon.
- **Touch and drag** to reorder dashboards.
- Use the **(+)** button to add a new dashboard.

When renaming or creating a dashboard, you can choose from a variety of icons to visually represent the dashboard's purpose (e.g., navigation, engine monitoring, weather). Icons are displayed in the dashboard menu for quick recognition.

## Editing Layout
To edit a dashboard's widgets and arrangement, you need to unlock its layout. View the desired dashboard, access the **Actions menu** on the right-hand side, and tap the bottom **unlock button**. The widgets will become surrounded by dashed borders, indicating you are in edit mode. Actions you can perform while editing a layout include:
- **Long press** an empty area of the dashboard to add a widget (you may need to free up space first).
- **Double tap** a widget to edit its configuration.
- **Touch and drag** a widget to reposition it.
- **Touch and drag** the edges of a widget to resize it.
- **Long press** a widget to delete or duplicate it.
- Use the lower right **Check button** to save changes or the **X button** to discard layout changes.
