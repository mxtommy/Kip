## Chartplotter Mode
Keep a live Freeboard‑SK chart visible while switching dashboards for an MFD‑style workflow. The chart persists (no reload or flicker), you can choose its side, collapse it per‑dashboard for full data pages, and drag resize the split. Layout auto‑stacks in portrait / narrow screens. See the dedicated Chartplotter Mode help page for setup, performance tips, and troubleshooting.

## Remote Control Other KIP Displays
Control which dashboard is shown on another KIP instance (e.g., a mast display, hard-to-reach screen, or a non‑touch device) from any KIP, including your phone.

Use cases
- Mast display: change dashboards from the cockpit.
- Wall/helm screens: toggle dashboards without standing up or reaching for controls.
- Non‑touch/no input: select dashboards when no keyboard/mouse is connected or touch is not supported/disabled.

## Dedicated Fullscreen instrument display (Kiosk Mode)
Runs KIP on Raspberry Pi as a single full-screen application, suppresses desktop UI and stays on screen like a dedicated instrument display at a fraction of the cost. Read the [Kiosk Mode](https://github.com/mxtommy/Kip/blob/master/src/assets/help-docs/kiosk.md) help file.

## Progressive Web App PWA
Run KIP in full-screen mode without browser controls, just like a native mobile app. This feature is supported on most mobile operating systems. Follow your browser's instructions to install KIP as a PWA for quick and easy access. It's usually just a few clicks, such as "Add to Home Screen".

## Multiple User Configurations
If you have different roles on board: captain, skipper, tactician, navigator, engineer—or simply different people with different needs, each can tailor KIP as they wish. The use of profiles also allows you to tie specific configuration arrangements to use cases or device form factors.

## Complementary Components
Typical complementary components you may install (most are often bundled with Signal K distributions):

**Navigation & Charting**
- **Freeboard‑SK** (pre-installed) – Multi‑station, web chart plotter dedicated to Signal K: routes, waypoints, charts, alarms, weather layers, and instrument overlays.

**Visual Flow / Automation**
- **Node‑RED** – Low‑code, flow‑based wiring of devices, APIs, online services, and custom logic (alert escalation, device control automation, data enrichment, protocol bridging).

**Data Storage & Analytics**
- **InfluxDB / other TSDB** – High‑resolution historical storage of sensor & performance metrics beyond what lightweight widget charts should retain.
- **Grafana** – Rich exploratory / comparative dashboards, ad‑hoc queries, alert rules on stored metrics, correlation across heterogeneous data sources.

## Harness the Power of Data State Notifications
Stay informed with notifications about the state of the data you are interested in.
For example, Signal K will notify KIP when a water depth or temperature sensor reaches certain levels. In addition to KIP's centralized notification menu, individual widgets offer tailored visual representations appropriate to their design objectives, providing an optimal user experience.

# How To Contribute
KIP is under the MIT license and is built with Node and Angular using various open-source assets. All free!

## Project Scope
What KIP IS about:
- Real‑time presentation of vessel & environment data (navigation, performance, systems) pulled from Signal K.
- Fast, legible, touchscreen‑friendly dashboards for underway decision making.
- Configurable widgets (gauges, charts, timers, controls) tuned for sailing operations.

What KIP deliberately IS NOT trying to become:
- A full data lake / long‑term time‑series historian.
- A general purpose automation / rules / orchestration engine.
- A universal external web‑app embedding or mash‑up framework.
- A low‑code integration hub for arbitrarily wiring protocols and services.

Those domains already have excellent, specialized open‑source tools. Instead of re‑implementing them, KIP plays nicely alongside them within a Signal K based onboard stack.

### Processing, Extensions and Widgets

#### Signal K Plugins
Domain‑specific enrichment (polars, performance calculations, derived environmental data, routing aids) published directly into the Signal K data model that KIP can then display.

#### KIP Widgets
Visual data representation component that use Signal K path data and API V2 features. Scaffolding a new widgets only takes a few moments and is backed by KIP AI agent instructions providing willed creative minds a personal assistant programmer.

Run one simple command (example):
```
npm run generate:widget
```
or ask your AI to create a widget using the KIP project AI instructions.

For deeper details you can still look at `COPILOT.md`, but you don’t need to in order to get started.

### Why this separation matters

Keeping KIP focused preserves responsiveness (lower CPU / memory), reduces UI clutter, and accelerates core sailing user experience development. Heavy analytics, complex workflow logic, and broad third‑party embedding stay where they are strongest—outside—but still feed KIP through the common Signal K data fabric.

In short: use KIP to see & act on live sailing information; use the complementary tools to store it long‑term, analyze it deeply, automate decisions, or build advanced integrations.

## Getting Started

**Linux, Mac, RPi, or Windows dev platform supported**
1. Download your favorite coding IDE (we use the free Visual Studio Code)
2. Create your own GitHub KIP fork.
3. Configure your IDE's source control to point it to your forked KIP instance (Visual Studio Code, GitHub support is built-in) and get the fork's master branch locally.
4. Install `npm` and `node`. On macOS, you can use `brew install node` if you have Homebrew. See https://nodejs.org/en/download for more options.
5. Install the Angular CLI using `npm install -g @angular/cli`

**Project Setup**
1. From your fork's master branch, create a working branch with a name such as: `new-widget-abc` or `fix-issue-abc`, etc.
2. Check out this new branch.
3. In a command shell (or in the Visual Studio Code Terminal window), go to the root of your local project folder, if not done automatically by your IDE.
4. Install project dependencies using the NPM package and dependency manager: run `npm install`. NPM will read the KIP project dependencies, download, and install everything automatically for you.
5. Build the app locally using Angular CLI: from that same project root folder, run `npm run build:all`. The CLI tool will build KIP.

**Code and Test**
1. Fire up your local KIP development instance with `npm run dev`.
2. Hit Run/Start Debugging in Visual Studio Code or manually point your favorite browser to `http://localhost:4200/@mxtommy/kip`. Alternatively, to start the development server and allow remote devices connections, such as with your phone or RPi (blocked for security reasons by default):  
   `ng serve --configuration=dev --serve-path=/@mxtommy/kip/ --host=<your computer's IP> --port=4200`
3. Voila!

*As you work on source code and save files, the app will automatically reload in the browser with your latest changes.*  
*You will also need a running Signal K server for KIP to connect to and receive data. You could also use https://demo.signalk.org but without authentication enabled, your actions, features and test coverage will be limited.*

**Apple PWA Icon Generation**

Use the following tool and command line:  
`npx pwa-asset-generator ./src/assets/favicon.svg ./src/assets/ -i ./src/index.html -m ./src manifest.json -b "linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(255,255,255,0.15) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0.15) 100%), radial-gradient(at top center, rgba(255,255,255,0.40) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0.40) 120%) #989898" -p 5%`

**Share**

Once done with your work, from your fork's working branch, make a GitHub pull request to have your code reviewed, merged, and included in the next release. It's always optimal to sync with us prior to engaging in extensive new development work.
